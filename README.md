# RideShare

RideShare is a ride-sharing application that allows users to search for available rides, create their own rides, and manage their ride requests and bookings. The project is built using React for the frontend and includes components for user authentication, ride search, ride creation, and ride management.

## Introduction

RideShare is a full-stack application that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for ride management and user authentication. The project consists of a React frontend and a Solidity smart contract for ride management. The application allows users to search for available rides, create their own rides, and manage their ride requests and bookings.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Web3.js: A library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
3. Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
4. Truffle: A development framework for Ethereum.
5. Ganache: A local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.

## **Architecture**

The application follows a modular architecture with separate components for user authentication, ride search, ride creation, and ride management. The frontend is built using React and utilizes Redux for state management. The backend is implemented as a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
